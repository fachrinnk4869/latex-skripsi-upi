  abstract  = "Autonomous vehicles can achieve accurate localization and
               real-time road information perception using sensors such as
               global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs), light detection and
               ranging (LiDAR), and inertial measurement units (IMUs). With
               road information, vehicles can navigate autonomously to a given
               position without traffic accidents. However, most of the
               research on autonomous vehicles has paid little attention to
               road profile information, which is a significant reference for
               vehicles driving on uneven terrain. Most vehicles experience
               violent vibrations when driving on uneven terrain, which reduce
               the accuracy and stability of data obtained by LiDAR and IMUs.
               Vehicles with an active suspension system, on the other hand,
               can maintain stability on uneven roads, which further guarantees
               sensor accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel method for
               road profile estimation using LiDAR and vehicles with an active
               suspension system. In the former, 3D laser scanners, IMU, and
               GPS were used to obtain accurate pose information and real-time
               cloud data points, which were added to an elevation map. In the
               latter, the elevation map was further processed by a Kalman
               filter algorithm to fuse multiple cloud data points at the same
               cell of the map. The model predictive control (MPC) method is
               proposed to control the active suspension system to maintain
               vehicle stability, thus further reducing drifts of LiDAR and IMU
               data. The proposed method was carried out in outdoor
               environments, and the experiment results demonstrated its
               accuracy and effectiveness.",
